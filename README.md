# C Programming Tutorial for Beginners
This is the first tutorial for C Programming that I watched on YouTube. It made me familiar with the C syntax and helped me transition from my school days of learning Java to being in college as a complete beginner in programming. It helped me build the foundation for my knowledge of C and C++.
